# Java Exercises Report

This repository contains a series of Java exercises that explore key concepts in object-oriented programming and data manipulation. Below is a summary of the exercises included:

## Exercise 1: Student Grades Management
The program allows the user to input a series of student grades and perform various operations such as:
1. **Sort and display the list of grades**: A simple sorting algorithm is applied to organize the grades.
2. **Calculate and display the average grade**: Iterates through the array of grades to compute the average.
3. **Display the maximum and minimum grades**: Identifies the highest and lowest grades by comparing values in the array.
4. **Count the occurrences of a specific grade**: Allows the user to input a grade and counts how many times it appears in the list.

All the operations are neatly packaged within the program using GitHub Actions for automation. Each push to the repository triggers a build process to ensure the code compiles and runs correctly.

## Exercise 2: Verb Conjugation (First Group Verbs)
This program reads a verb from the user (belonging to the first group, ending in "-er") and displays its conjugation in the present tense. The steps include:
- Unifying the verb case (convert to lowercase).
- Verifying that the verb ends with "-er".
- Removing the "-er" suffix and conjugating the verb accordingly.

The program provides a structured approach to ensure only valid first group verbs are processed.

## Exercise 3: String Operations Menu
This program reads a string from the user and allows them to perform the following operations:
1. **Input**: Reads a string from the user and stores it in a variable.
2. **Display**: Outputs the string.
3. **Reverse**: Reverses the string and displays the result.
4. **Word Count**: Counts the number of words in the string, treating spaces as delimiters (handles multiple consecutive spaces).

The user can select operations from a menu, and the program will loop until the user chooses to exit.

## Exercise 4: Counting Letter Occurrences in a String
This program reads a string from the user and counts how many times each letter of the alphabet appears, ignoring case (i.e., 'a' and 'A' are treated the same). It:
- Initializes an array to hold the count of each letter (26 letters in total).
- Converts the input string to uppercase.
- Counts the occurrences of each letter.
- Displays only the letters that appear at least once.
